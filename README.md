Gravity Scales
==============

This repository contains a system of scales that can be substituted to build tension around a dominant (V7) chord before resolving to the tonic (I) major or minor chord.

The 12 scales in the major group are a condensed version of Ted Dunbar's "gravities" as described in his book "A System of Tonal Convergence for Improvisers Composers and Arrangers." It can be found at http://www.scribd.com/doc/144792787/Ted-Dunbar-A-System-of-Tonal-Convergence.

The 5 scales in the minor group are a combination of John Stowell's 4 melodic minor scales (http://www.bobbysternjazz.com/1/post/2014/01/stowell-from-john-4-melodic-minor-scales-as-dominant-subs.html) and a harmonic minor scale.

The first 4 scales in each group are the same. They are also listed below.  I am aware than more than 4 of the scales in the major group may also work with minor key resolution.  I still have to sort that out.  This will be a work in progress for awhile.

The scales are transcribed to resolve to the key of F. They all start on a C, which is the 5th note in the key.

Enjoy!
