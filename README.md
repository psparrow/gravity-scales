Gravity Scales
==============

This repository contains a system of scales that can be substituted to build tension around a dominant (V7) chord before resolving to the tonic (I) major or minor chord.

The 12 scales in the major group are a condensed version of Ted Dunbar's "gravities" as described in his book "A System of Tonal Convergence for Improvisers Composers and Arrangers." It can be found at http://www.scribd.com/doc/144792787/Ted-Dunbar-A-System-of-Tonal-Convergence.

The 5 scales in the minor group are a combination of John Stowell's 4 melodic minor scales (http://www.bobbysternjazz.com/1/post/2014/01/stowell-from-john-4-melodic-minor-scales-as-dominant-subs.html) and a harmonic minor scale.

The first 4 scales in each group are the same. They are also listed below.  I am aware than more than 4 of the scales in the major group may also work with minor key resolution.  I still have to sort that out.  This will be a work in progress for awhile.

The scales in this branch of the repository are tabbed out for P4 tuning (A.K.A all fourths or perfect fourths). If you play in that tuning, they can be transposed anywhere on the neck!

Enjoy!
